Q1: What is the difference between EBS and S3?
EBS is a block storage to be used with any specific EC2 instances. It is only available in a particular geographical areas where it is initially created from. It is analogous to
an external hard disk which can be formatted and is backed up
On the other hand, S3 buckets are objects (and not a file system) that is relatively cheaper than EBS. It is also accessible from any geographical location which makes it easier for 
usage in any world wide application (such as logging to a website)

Q2: When would you consider a cloud infrastructure for your data science tasks?
There may be a variety of reasons to consider a cloud based infrastructure setup as opposed to traditional data centres. If we are unsure of the demand of the new application that is 
being developed, cloud would be a great option because it can be scaled as per the demand requirement. Also, cloud offers a faster to market solution with no hassle of maintaining a separate
IT team. 

Q3: What is the difference between spot instances and reserved instances?
Reserved instances are cheaper than on-demand (spot) EC2 instances, for the same configuration of EC2 clusters. Reserved instances is analogous to reserving capacity on the 
Amazon cloud in advance. Such a reservation is rewarded by cheaper prices from Amazon. However, the users need to enter into either a 1 or 3 year contract. Hence, the users lose
flexibility of changing the machine configurations while obtaining a cheaper prices. If a service has predictable demand over the near future, reserved instances is a better option.
