Each hospital conducted a survey of patients to obtain satisfactory ratings. Out of this a base score and consistency score were computed.
For purposes of this analysis, these two scores are added to obtain a total score for each hospital.

This total score assessed by patients is correlated with teh average rank percentile to see if the hospital rankings has any correlation with patient evaluations.

The correlation coefficients turned out to be a -0.169 which shows that the patients perception of care in the hospitals seems to be opposite to the actual care that is being provided.
